# ðŸŽ¯ Dynamic LP Market Maker Vault

## Overview

The **Dynamic LP Market Maker Vault** is a Solana smart contract (program) built with **Anchor** that enables **automated liquidity rebalancing across price bands** on decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

The vault allows users to deposit token pairs, mint share tokens representing ownership, and automatically rebalances liquidity within specified price bands (e.g., every 5 basis points).  
It helps liquidity providers maximize trading fees, maintain optimal market depth, and minimize impermanent loss.

This project was developed in Solana Playground IDE
